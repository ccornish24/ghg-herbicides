Wetlands play a disproportionate role in the global climate as major sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. Herbicides are the most heavily used agrochemicals and are frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems, with glyphosate and 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), representing the two most commonly used worldwide. In recent years, these herbicides are being used in mixtures to combat herbicide-tolerant noxious weeds. While it is well documented that herbicide use for agriculture is expected to increase, their indirect effects on wetland greenhouse gas dynamics are virtually unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a factorial microcosm experiment using low, medium, and high concentrations of glyphosate or 2,4-D, individually and in combination to investigate their effects on wetland methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide fluxes. We predicted that mixed herbicide treatments would have a synergistic effect on greenhouse gases compared to individual herbicides. Our results showed that carbon dioxide flux rates and cumulative emissions significantly increased from both individual and mixed herbicide treatments, whereas methane and nitrous oxide dynamics were less affected. This study suggests that extensive use of glyphosate and 2,4-D may increase carbon dioxide emissions from wetlands, which could have implications for climate change.
